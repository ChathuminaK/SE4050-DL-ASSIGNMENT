## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains deep learning models and experiments for the SE4050 course assignment. All notebooks are designed to run on **Google Colab** for easy execution and GPU acceleration.

## 📁 Repository Structure
```
SE4050-DL-ASSIGNMENT/
├── 📓 notebooks/          # Google Colab notebooks
└── 📖 README.md          # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ☁️ Running on Google Colab

1. **Open in Colab**
   - Click on any notebook file in the `notebooks/` folder
   - Click the "Open in Colab" badge or manually upload to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. **Mount Google Drive** (if needed)
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run All Cells**
   - Use `Runtime > Run all` in the Colab menu

### 💾 Dataset Setup

Upload your dataset to Google Drive or use direct download links in the notebooks:
```python
# Example: Download dataset
!wget <dataset-url>
!unzip dataset.zip
```
